### BalanceBuddy ###
BalanceBuddy is a simple budgeting app designed with a gameify twist. The app works just like a normal budgeting app, you can track expenses & income, set goals, and keep track of your overall finances. The twist is that just by using the app regularly, you earn experience points and can compete with friends and other users to see who can get the most experience. There will be a leaderboard to track which users are at the top of the game in terms of experience points.

The goal of having this "gamified" version of a budgeting app is to increase user engagement and to help keep the user coming back to the app. Many people will start using a budgeting app of some sort and get bored of it and stop using it after only a short time. Our goal is to give the user a reason to keep coming back and using the app; competition.
