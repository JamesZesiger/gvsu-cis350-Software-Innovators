# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

We plan to create a budgeting application aimed at College Students to help them with saving money and manageing expenses. Our goal is to create a user-friendly app that people can use to track expenses, build different kinds of budgets, set personal goals for their finances, and to track their progress toward their goals. We wanted to try to *"gamify"* the app and make it more fun for users so that they are more engaged and more likely to continue budgeting and saving money. We have ideas for some more advanced features such as a point system and user leaderboard so users can compete without exposing their specific financial situations.

Our target audience is College Students because of the financial struggles that come with being a College Student. There are tons of expenses that College Students have to deal with while also being in school and possibly even working a job. It is very hard to keep track of everything as a College Student, and our goal is to make a place to make tracking expenses and money easier, so the students can keep focusing on their classes.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)

Main programming language: Python
We plan to use python and some python libraries to put together the logic and UI for the budgeting app. We also plan to have a SQL database which is linked into the app to store user data. 

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

We plan to use Agile development and a Kanban board as our main method for the project. Due to the short time-frame and small team that we have for this project, we believe Agile devleopment will be best, because we anticipate our project scope to be ever changing. We want to use a Kanban board to track tasks and keep everyone on task and up-to-date since it is difficult to schedule regular meetings.
